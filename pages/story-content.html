      <h2>Ben Hogarth an Australian freelance TV producer travels through Iran</h2>

      <p class="highlight">This is Gholam Ali. He&#39;s 89 years old. He&#39;s a father of five. A
      husband for 67 years. And half blind. We met in an alleyway in Kang, a small village in
      north-western Iran.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      The people of Iran:

      <ul class="qlinks">
        <li>
          <a href="#one">Gholam Ali</a>
        </li>

        <li>
          <a href="#two">Mr Ahmed</a>
        </li>

        <li>
          <a href="#three">Assa</a>
        </li>

        <li>
          <a href="#four">Yadz</a>
        </li>

        <li>
          <a href="#five">Muhammad</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h4 id="one">Gholam Ali</h4>

      <p>Within seconds, he offered to take me to his small mud-brick home for cups of tea. His
      house was basic, just a single photo on the wall. A portrait of himself. He has lived in this
      village his whole life - his family has been in Kang for thousands of years. He quickly
      prepared the tea, along with apples and walnuts from his meagre garden, before sitting down
      to chat.</p>

      <p>For the next three hours we spoke (through a translator). He told stories from his past -
      as a teenager he remembers the marauding Turkmen raiding the village and kidnapping his
      neighbours. He spoke of the Soviet soldiers who occupied his village after the Second World
      War. He revelled in the tale of how he killed a panther with a knife - earning him the title
      ‘Panther Killer’.</p>

      <p>At one point I asked about his one and only photo. It was of him at age 60. It was taken
      the day he volunteered for the Iranian army to fight Saddam Hussein’s invading forces. He
      served 6 months on the front line- losing three family members in one battle.</p>

      <p>He’s built two mosques and one school for his village - with his own hands and paying for
      it out of his own pocket. His one good eye glistened with a tear when he said Allah will
      reward him in the afterlife. It was this precise moment that he asked me to photograph.</p>

      <p>I’m not sure what Gholam gained from our conversation - maybe just a fresh set of ears to
      listen to his life stories. Maybe it helped take his mind off his wife, who has fallen
      ill.</p>

      <p>For me, it was one of my greatest travel experiences. It was simply tea, but the stories
      changed the way I looked at his region, his country and his faith. He embodies humility,
      integrity, family and community. I hope at 89, I can entertain for three hours like him.</p>

      <p>At the end I asked Gholam Ali to pose with his single photo. His spirit to live hasn’t
      diminished at all with time.</p>

      <p>Tomorrow I will get the picture sent to him. Hopefully he will decide to put two photos on
      the wall.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h4 id="two">Mr Ahmed</h4>

      <p><img alt="" src="http://aphs.worldnomads.com/connectlocally/27791/Photo2.jpg"></p>

      <p>This is Mr Ahmed. He reads the Quran every morning as part of his daily ritual. We spoke
      (hand signals) for twenty minutes before he grabbed my hand and walked me to a little
      bookshop where he bought me the Quran for $3. He knew I was not a man of faith, but wanted me
      to remember him. I intend to do just that.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h4 id="three">Assa</h4>

      <p><img alt="" src="http://aphs.worldnomads.com/connectlocally/27791/Photo3.jpg"></p>

      <p>This is Assa. I travelled around 9 hours by train to the holy city of Mashhad, around
      200kms from the Afghan border. I sat next to this girl's brother who was fascinated by my
      phone and headphones. After 7 hours of staring, I asked if he would like to listen to some
      music, which his parents approved. For 15 minutes he had his first taste of Johnny Cash, Led
      Zeppelin, Pearl Jam and the Foo Fighters. I hope the smile on his face indicated he was
      influenced by the music in same way I was at his age. I got this photo of Assa, as the train
      stopped for prayer time.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h4 id="four">Yadz</h4>

      <p><img alt="" src="http://aphs.worldnomads.com/connectlocally/27791/Photo4.jpg"></p>

      <p>In Yadz, a young Iranian girl came up to me and began a conversation in broken English.
      Her family took photos of us as we spoke. She said she's been studying English for two years
      and uses Hollywood films and American songs to help. She said her family is very proud of
      her. As I said goodbye, she ran to her family and started to cry embracing her mother. The
      whole family began to clap for her - these were tears of joy and pride in her hard work
      learning a new language. Our simple conversation meant the world to her. This is her
      grandfather, who nearly shook my hand off.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h4 id="five">Muhammad</h4>

      <p><img alt="" src="http://aphs.worldnomads.com/connectlocally/27791/Photo5.jpg"></p>

      <p>This is Muhammad. He sells boot polish on the streets of Yazd. He asked me to take his
      photo in the morning sun, which I happily did. Later that night I met Muhammad again. He
      spotted me standing in line for fresh bread and quickly paid before I even reached for my
      wallet. I think Muhammad personifies Iran.</p>

      <p><img alt="" src="http://aphs.worldnomads.com/connectlocally/27791/Photo6.jpg"></p>

      <p>Mashhad, Iran. For thousands of years, it has been a trading point on the legendary Silk
      Road. The 4000 kilometre merchant route that linked Asia to Europe since 200BC. It still has
      a beating heart today. It was a pleasure to sit with Afghans, Iraqis, Kurds, Iranians,
      Turkmen and local tribal dealers and talk travel and share dirty jokes. Away from the
      newspaper headlines, our differences were very small.</p>
